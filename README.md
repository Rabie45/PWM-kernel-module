# PWM-kernel_module
A PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) kernel module in Linux is a piece of software that allows the kernel to interface with PWM hardware on the system. PWM is commonly used for controlling devices like LEDs, motors, and other peripherals where you need to vary the duty cycle to control the power delivered to the device.
